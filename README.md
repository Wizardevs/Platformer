# Platformer
This project is a sample project. This project can be used by any game developer (beginner, intermediate or advanced) and can be edited it any way! The source code for this project is on Github, this itch.io page is just a live demo so people can see what they're downloading. The project currently contains:

- Portals

- 4 sample scenes

- Obstacles

- Infinite jump

- Player movement

The project is always being updated, we might add some enemies and some SFX and background music, as well :)
